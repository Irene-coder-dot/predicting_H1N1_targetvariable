    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Vaccination is one of the most effective tools in public health to combat the spread of infectious diseases. In addition to protecting individuals, vaccines contribute to herd immunity, reducing transmission within communities. While modern attention has focused on the COVID-19 pandemic, this project revisits the public health response to a prior global outbreak: the 2009 H1N1 (swine flu) pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "The H1N1 virus emerged in early 2009 and led to an estimated 151,000 to 575,000 deaths worldwide during its first year. A vaccine was introduced in October 2009, and to assess public response, the U.S. launched the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey. This telephone survey gathered data on whether individuals received the H1N1  vaccines, alongside questions about their personal, economic, and demographic backgrounds, opinions on vaccine safety and effectiveness, and behaviors related to disease prevention. Despite the availability of the vaccine, not everyone chose to get vaccinated.\n",
    "\n",
    "This leads to :\n",
    "\n",
    "## The core business problem\n",
    "\n",
    "How can public health organizations identify which individuals are likely or unlikely to receive the H1N1 vaccine, so they can design more targeted and effective vaccination campaigns?\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing these survey responses,My aim is to uncover patterns in vaccination behavior and build a predictive model. Insights from this model could inform future vaccination campaigns, helping public health agencies better understand and address vaccine hesitancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "The outcomes of this project are valuable to several key stakeholders:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Public Health Agencies (CDC, WHO, local departments):\n",
    "Use predictions and feature insights to tailor outreach and vaccine education campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Healthcare Providers:\n",
    "Identify at-risk populations for vaccine refusal and intervene through personalized guidance and education.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Policy Makers:\n",
    "Allocate resources more effectively by targeting communities or demographics less likely to get vaccinated.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Non-Profit Organizations and NGOs:\n",
    "Support data-driven public awareness campaigns and deliver educational programs where needed most.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data Scientists and Researchers:\n",
    "Gain insights into behavioral modeling and its implications for health-related prediction tasks."

    "## Data Source:\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses data from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey (NHFS), conducted in the United States following the emergence of the H1N1 (swine flu) pandemic. The survey was designed to assess vaccine uptake and gather individual-level data on demographics, opinions, and behaviors related to flu prevention and vaccination. It is a relevant and high-quality source for modeling public health behavior during a real-world pandemic scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is divided into three files:\n",
    "\n",
    "* training_set_features.csv – Includes responses from 26,707 individuals with 36 features related to demographic, behavioral, and opinion-based attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "* training_set_labels.csv – Contains binary indicators of whether the respondent received the H1N1 vaccine and the seasonal flu vaccine.\n",
    "\n",
    "* test_set_features.csv – Contains data for 26,708 individuals with the same features as the training set; target labels are not provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Demographic features (e.g., age group, sex, race, income, education):\n",
    "Important for identifying population-level trends in vaccine uptake.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Behavioral features (e.g., face mask use, hand washing, social behavior):\n",
    "Reflect how seriously individuals took preventive measures, which may correlate with vaccination behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Opinion features (e.g., trust in vaccine effectiveness, perceived risk of illness):\n",
    "Crucial for understanding personal beliefs and vaccine hesitancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "These features are highly relevant for predicting H1N1 vaccine behavior, as they reflect key factors studied in public health research: health beliefs, socio-demographics, and behavioral intentions.\n",
